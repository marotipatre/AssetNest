 Flow over a fund invesment in the traditional financial market -

  - *Distributor & Fund:* The distributor acts as a bridge between the fund and potential investors, marketing and selling the fund's financial products.

  - *Exchange & Fund:* Exchanges serve as vital platforms where funds can actively participate in trading activities, acquiring or disposing of assets as per their investment strategies.
  
  - *Custodian & Fund:* Custodians play a pivotal role in safeguarding the assets of the fund, ensuring that they are held securely and are not susceptible to theft or loss. Apart from asset safekeeping.
