## Overall Project Introduction
- *Project Background:*

   > "The idea came from our own experience with the fund industry, both of us on the team have already/still interned at investment funds, in the normal asset analysis part. Crypto is not yet so widespread in Brazil, despite the growing expansion, and we saw the potential to decentralize the entire investment process in funds using smart contract technologies. Thus arose whale.finance."

- *Project Introduction:*

  - Whale Finance allow managers to hold assets from investors priorizing *security*. In this way, we can basically make a descentralized asset management. The platform is designed for the two publics: The depositors, who will be able to deposit their tokens in really great vaults managed by experts in a safe way, and the traders, who will be able to manage and hold depositor tokens and can have a profit to themselves.

- *Project Explanation:*

  - First of all, it it's necessary, there is an attachment section below in this ReadMe file to explane more about financial market, specifically hedge funds. The essence of Whale Finance is basically safety first in transactions, highlighting its innovative approach to asset management.

  - *Decentralized Management of Tokenized Assets:* Whale Finance is a protocol for the decentralized management of a variety of tokenized assets in the future, including native crypto assets.

  - *Investment Mechanisms and Security:* The platform uses social verification with Farcaster to validate the manager reputation, also providing a way to self promote vaults. Besides that, depositors can have the rish shared by a deposit of a collateral (like perpetuals) by the trader to perform operations with the depositor tokens.

  - *Pricing and Bussiness Health:* The platform can explore the integration with Farcaster to have more marketing, and the pricing is very simple and similar to the traditional finance, we will take about 2% of fee from TVL, like the performance fee taken by the trader (variable for each trader, but can be like 20% of the vault earnings). In this way, we can earn an administration fee of 2% of the platform TVL per year with a low cost to mantain the platform.

- *Why Solana?*

  - *High Transaction Throughput:* The capacity for a ihgh volume of transactions per second ensures efficient handling of high-volume activities, crucial for Asset Management Projects, like Whale Finance.

  - *Fast Transaction Confirmation Times:* With a short block time, the chain offers rapid transaction processing, beneficial for the timely execution of DeFi operations.

  - *Low Gas Fee Transaction Cost:* It enables the trader to perform more operations and still have the earnings not impacted by transaction cost.

- *Programs:*

  - *Create Fund program ID:* 55tC9joryrqBuUJjURE5i2pLLbzoFfx1K1hRWnMfigtF (deployed in Devnet)

## Attachment Information

### Traditional

Before that, to give some context, the stakeholders of the financial market explained:

  - Distributor: Markets and sells financial products to investors.
  
  - Exchange: Platform for buying and selling financial assets.
  
  - Custodian: Safeguards and manages financial assets.
  
  - Fund: Pooled investment vehicle managed professionally.
  
  These bullet points below describes the flow over a fund invesment in the traditional financial market, with 6 main stakeholders:
  
  - *Investor & Fund:* To have a share in the fund, the investor must pay a management fee to the manager, and a performance fee equivalent to a percentage above the market benchmark. In this way, the manager aligns with the investment by earning these fees for managing the fund.
  
  - *Distributor & Fund:* The distributor acts as a bridge between the fund and potential investors, marketing and selling the fund's financial products. Through collaborations and agreements, distributors help expand the fund's reach and increase its assets under management, enhancing the fund's visibility and accessibility.
  
  - *Exchange & Fund:* Exchanges serve as vital platforms where funds can actively participate in trading activities, acquiring or disposing of assets as per their investment strategies. They facilitate a transparent environment where funds can execute trades based on real-time market conditions, thus helping in the price discovery process and achieving investment objectives.
  
  - *Custodian & Fund:* Custodians play a pivotal role in safeguarding the assets of the fund, ensuring that they are held securely and are not susceptible to theft or loss. Apart from asset safekeeping, they also assist in transaction settlements and administrative services, thus ensuring smooth operational flow and compliance with regulatory requirements.
